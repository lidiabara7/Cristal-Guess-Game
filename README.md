# Crystal Guess Game

There are four cystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each cristal has a different hidden value. The user will be shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The point of the game is to match the value of the crystals to the value of a random number. Each crystal has a hidden value that is shown when clicked. The values add up after the clicks. If your total score is greater than the value of the random number then you lose, if it matches then you win. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. 
When the page is refreshed the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

This app was developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascrip.
