# Crystal Guess Game

The point of the game is to match the value of the crystals to the value of a random number. Each crystal has a different hidden value that is shown when clicked. The values add up after the clicks. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. 
When the page is refreshed the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

This app was developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
